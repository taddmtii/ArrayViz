What needs to still be done:

- Implement Predict Mode
- general error checking
- Highlight statements/expressions within the UI as commands execute/undo. Highlights need to disappear when code is deleted/not being stepped through.
- implement all undos for every single command so we can step back!
- Continue looking into potential bugs with range()
- variable interpolation in strings (f string)
- debug factorial func / return commands. FIRST RETURN that shows up always returns there instead of skipping.

    def fact(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1 // returns 1 insetad of skipping, maybe we do not jump properly.
        return n * fact(n - 1)

    print(fact(5))

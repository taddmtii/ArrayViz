What needs to still be done:

- Implement Predict Mode
- general error checking
- Highlight statements/expressions within the UI as commands execute/undo (basic implementation, double check this)
- Implement user defined functions
- implement all undos for every single command so we can step back!

- look into how python handles iterables / nested for loops. Am I currently doing that?

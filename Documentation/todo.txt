What needs to still be done:

- function and global frames
- Prof O indexing visualization proposal
- Create preset options in the UI for auto populated code for basic sorts and searches 
- Expression support within f-strings
- Better highlighting/more intuitive
- Add class functionality
- small QOL language features

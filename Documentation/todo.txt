What needs to still be done:

- Implement Predict Mode
- general error checking
- Highlight statements/expressions within the UI as commands execute/undo. Highlights need to disappear when code is deleted/not being stepped through.
- implement all undos for every single command so we can step back
- Create preset options in the UI for auto populated code for the following sorts and searches:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search

- fix list slicing
#Test list slicing
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[2:5])    # [2, 3, 4]
print(numbers[:3])     # [0, 1, 2]
print(numbers[7:])     # [7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[::2])    # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
print(numbers[1:7:2])  # [1, 3, 5]

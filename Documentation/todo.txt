What needs to still be done:

- In frames, I am not seeing "function frames" or local scopes whatever they are called. If we have a variable declared inside of a function, it is only just showing up in the global frame.

Notes:

For:

x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
result = z * 2
print(result)

stepping back does not remove variables from the frames at all.


SECOND SEMESTER GOALS:
- Create preset options in the UI for auto populated code for the following sorts and searches:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search

- Expression support within f-strings

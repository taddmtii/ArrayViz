What needs to still be done:

- In frames, I am not seeing "function frames" or local scopes whatever they are called. If we have a variable declared inside of a function, it is only just showing up in the global frame.


SECOND SEMESTER GOALS:
- Create preset options in the UI for auto populated code for the following sorts and searches:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search

- Expression support within f-strings

What needs to still be done:

- fix input()
- fix break, not breaking at all.
- when iterating over a list, for loop eats each element from list in visualization (not sure if it also changes it in the state as well) example:


mylist = [4, 5, 6]
for val in mylist:
   print(val)

OUTPUT: 4, 5, 6
but here are the variables:

mylist :
[]
val :
6


- double check nested for loops
- general error checking
- Highlight statements/expressions within the UI as commands execute/undo
- Implement user defined functions
- implement built in range() function
- implement all undos for every single command
- add type converter functirons
